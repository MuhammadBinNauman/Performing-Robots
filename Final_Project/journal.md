### Songs Purposed

confused on which one to pick 

1. Mulan: I'll Make a Man Out of You
2. Up: Married Life

#### Charecters

In Mulan: there will be two main charecters and two minor charecters that will be played

In UP: there will be two main charecters

#### Costume

In both there will be humanoid looking robots that will perform the action. This will allow better representation of the charecters they are adapted from

Mulan: the clothing will mimic the colors that are seen on the clothes of the 
chrecters with the design of the clothes being drawn with a  marker on the carboard.
other props the chrecters use or wear will be made from carboard

UP: same, but since they wear mordern attire, will most propably use actual clothing (Tie, Hat etc.) the rest will be drawn on

#### Technical Requirements:

In both plays the charecters will have to perform actions similar to that seen the actual scene. the play will more be concentrated on the emotional aspect of the play where the acitons will hold more importance that will be guided by the song. In parts where the charecter will sing the robots will also use the OLED to lipsync the part of the song. The OLED will also be used to express the emotions of the charecters, this will be done by closing up to the robot when the scene considers the facial expression critical to the emotion of the scene. The song will be played in the background rather than the MP3 trigger to maintain better audio clarity of the song.

#### Environment:

Will first try implement a green screen to will prop background elements inorder to make scenes but if not possible then will only use props and my room to make some thing that evokes the scene in the song

#### Action:
The song will determine the pace of the performence. the robots will try to mimic the action in the actual song.
The robots will have multiple props attached to them to better enact the scenes in the song. 
The robots will also do actions that give hints of more emotional and human like connection to the performence.
The robots will perform a varity of small and fast or slow movements to better mimic the small but impactful moments of the song
