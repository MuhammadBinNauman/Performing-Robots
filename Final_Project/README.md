## Pre-Showcase

### Songs Purposed
1. Up: Married Life

#### Charecters

In Mulan: there will be two main charecters and two minor charecters that will be played

In UP: there will be two main charecters

#### Costume

In both there will be humanoid looking robots that will perform the action. This will allow better representation of the charecters they are adapted from

Mulan: the clothing will mimic the colors that are seen on the clothes of the 
chrecters with the design of the clothes being drawn with a  marker on the carboard.
other props the chrecters use or wear will be made from carboard

UP: same, but since they wear mordern attire, will most propably use actual clothing (Tie, Hat etc.) the rest will be drawn on

#### Technical Requirements:

In both plays the charecters will have to perform actions similar to that seen the actual scene. the play will more be concentrated on the emotional aspect of the play where the acitons will hold more importance that will be guided by the song. In parts where the charecter will sing the robots will also use the OLED to lipsync the part of the song. The OLED will also be used to express the emotions of the charecters, this will be done by closing up to the robot when the scene considers the facial expression critical to the emotion of the scene. The song will be played in the background rather than the MP3 trigger to maintain better audio clarity of the song.

#### Environment:

Will first try implement a green screen to will prop background elements inorder to make scenes but if not possible then will only use props and my room to make some thing that evokes the scene in the song

#### Action:
The song will determine the pace of the performence. the robots will try to mimic the action in the actual song.
The robots will have multiple props attached to them to better enact the scenes in the song. 
The robots will also do actions that give hints of more emotional and human like connection to the performence.
The robots will perform a varity of small and fast or slow movements to better mimic the small but impactful moments of the song


## After Showcase
The play that was chosen at the end was UP(Married Life) from pixar. The play was about the life of a married couple up until the passing of the wife. 

#### Core Concepts
One of the main aspects of the play is the massage of time and the love and care of the couple.

#### Props and costumes 
to show case the progression of time of the key aspects that I focused on was the robots changing costumes every scene. another way to show the passage of time was to change the top of the robot from brown to white as the scenes progressed. To show the love and care between the couple several objects were identified that had the most impact in the song and were made into props.

The windmill prop previously used for the midterm was resued as the painting of the house on top of the waterfall.

The seats were a very core aspect in conveying the relation between the couple and hence used in the respective scenes of the song. the props were also reused as the give more virtical height to the windmill

The mailbox was also used as a important role in one of the scenes where both the robots would interact with. the stool was used to give more vertical height and help convey the scenes better 

![](pic7.jpg)

The car was the old robot being reused to fill in the for the actual scene where the car breaks down. The ballon stand was used in two scenes where the robot would have the interaction with it 

![](pic8.jpg)

The outfits of the robot where the main prop that was used for all scenes and helped in conveying the progress of time from scene to scene

![](pic11.jpg)

The plastic models were used as the crowd in the wedding scene. 
the one on the right was more dynamic in pose so it better represented its crowd while the other was more static and help represent its crowd

The green screen was essential in making the entire performance come to life

#### The Performence

The performance was a one to one of the source material. whenever possible the same movements and emotions were shown and the time where is was not possible different similar movements where made

##### The Robots 

![](pic1.jpg)

The robots was made as modular as possible. the head came off so that the redboard can be easily uploaded with the new scene code. The arms are fully rotatable so that they can be positioned according to the scene.

The button was put at the side for easy access for the movments to be initated from

The other charecter was similarly made but lacking in electronics

#### Problems and challenges
The main challenge was time mamagement the coding, recording and editing of the performence was time consuming 
The other challenge was getting the robot to move the way I wanted it to since the motors were imprecise it took some time to get the right code down

The Problems that were faced was with the green screen being very inconsistent from scene to scene due to lighting 
The other problem was the OLED having dead pixels all of the sudden in the middle of the screen, this caused some animations to be changed 
The last was finding the right surface for the robot to have the least friction in. the table was a good solution to that.
